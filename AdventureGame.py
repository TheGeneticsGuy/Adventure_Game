# Assignment:       Project 03 - Adventure Game
# Tools             Generating some of the text word art required assistance with a free resource:
#                   https://tools.picsart.com/text/font-generator/text-art/

# Description       This is a text-based adventure game, with multiple layers deep. 
#                   Each scenario has multiple layers of depth, and multiple endings. There are good and bad endings. You only will be counted towards a "win" if you complete a "good" ending. Your adventure is up for you to decide! It will also record the number of times you win as you return to the title screen.

# Additional Notes: An attempt to add an text animation is rewarded at the end of some GOOD and BAD endings. You can view this by typing "N". Just for fun.

# 2 users Exp:      First User: My 12 year-old daughter was the first to try it. She restarted multiple paths and loved it. She commented that it seems like she kept winning, so I showed
#                   her a path where she could die, and her exact words were "So I was just lucky!" Yes, yes she was! 

#                   Second User: My wife was the second to try it. She started multiple paths and oddly, chose literally the exact same path as my daughter the first try. So I had her try
#                   again. I guess it is just more fun to attack than to retreat!
